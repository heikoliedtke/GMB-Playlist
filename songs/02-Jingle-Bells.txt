title: Jingle Bells
---
Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way.
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.

Jingle, bells! Jingle, bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
Jingle, bells! Jingle, bells! Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fannie Bright was seated by my side.-
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot,
He got into a drifted bank and we, we got upsot.

Jingle, bells! Jingle, bells! Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
Jingle, bells! Jingle, bells! Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
